               "One of the best things about packing in to a State Park is getting off the beaten path, literally, and
               connecting with nature and what it has to offer. Blufftop views
               are just one of the amazing natural wonders that you will come across when you venture off the trail.
               These spots give you an opportunity to relax and reflect without
               the intrusions of everyday life "

            <h2>Sleeping Quarters</h2>
            <p>
               "The pack weight is a big concern when you are hiking miles into a park to find that perfect camp sight.
               Instead of carrying all of the weight of a tent, you can lighten
               the load by bringing a hammock. This also adds the benefit of sleeping off the ground. A lightweight tarp
               can be hung above your hammock to creat shelter and privacy."

            <p>
               "When you are miles away from any type of plumbing infracstructure, you have to use sources of fresh
               water that are available along the way. You don't want to introduce
               any type of chemical soaps to the fesh river or stream water, which makes it important to bring in all
               natural soap, or stick to just rinsing with water. You can also filter
               or boil the water to refill the reservoir in your pack, and to cook your meals. The river also provides a
               nice calm place to relax before heading back on the trail."
